# Running Azure DevOps agents on Azure Kubernetes Service

This repository contains the necessary files to run Azure DevOps agents, Linux & Windows, on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

The first thing you need to do is create a couple of Agent Pools in Azure DevOps. You can do this by navigating to the `Organization Settings` -> `Agent Pools` and clicking on `Add Pool`. Repeat this process for the Linux and Windows agent pools. Make sure to save the names of the pools as you will need them later.

Once you have created them, you will need a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `Agent Pools (read, manage)` scope. You can do this by navigating to `User Settings` -> `Personal access tokens` and clicking on `New Token`. Make sure to save the token as you will not be able to see it again.

Make sure you save your PAT in a `.env` file in the root of the repository. The file should look like this:

```bash
PAT=<your-pat>
```

Then load the environment variables by running the following command:

```bash
source scripts/00-set-variables.sh
```

## Create Azure resources

The next step is to create the necessary Azure resources. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
source scripts/01-create-rg-and-aks.sh
```

It will create a resource group and an AKS cluster. The AKS cluster will be created with a single node pool with a `Standard_B2s` VM size. This cluster will scale up to 3 nodes and down to 1 node.

## Build the Docker images for the agents, Linux and Windows

The next step is to build the Docker image for the agents. 

This is the command to build the Docker image for the Linux agent:

```bash
source scripts/02-build-docker-image-for-the-lx-agent.sh
```

This is the command to build the Docker image for the Windows agent:

```bash
source scripts/03-build-docker-image-for-the-win-agent.sh
```

You can test it locally by running the following commands:

```bash
az acr login --name $ACR_NAME

docker pull $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/ado-agent:$IMAGE_ID
docker run --rm -e AZP_URL="https://dev.azure.com/$ORGANIZATION_NAME" -e AZP_POOL="$AGENT_POOL_NAME" -e AZP_TOKEN=$PAT $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/ado-agent:$IMAGE_ID
```

## Deploy manifests to AKS

The next step is to deploy the manifests to AKS. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
source scripts/04-apply-manifests-for-linux-agents.sh

watch kubectl get pods -n linux-agents

kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods  -n linux-agents -l app=azdevops-agent -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")  -n linux-agents
```

```bash
source scripts/05-apply-manifests-for-windows-agents.sh

watch kubectl get pods -n windows-agents

kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods  -n windows-agents -l app=azdevops-agent -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")  -n windows-agents
```

Hurrah ðŸŽ‰! You now have a running Azure DevOps agent on AKS. You can check the logs by running the following command:

```bash
```

And you can see how the pod scales by running the following command:

```bash
watch kubectl get pods -l app=azdevops-agent
```

Also It's good to see if the KEDA is working properly by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe scaledobject azure-pipelines-scaledobject
watch kubectl get scaledobject
```

## How to test it

I've created a couple of pipelines to test this new pool. You can find them in the `pipelines` folder. You can import them into your Azure DevOps organization and run them.

## Clean up

Don't forget to clean up the resources once you are done. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
source scripts/06-clean-up.sh
```

Happy coding!
